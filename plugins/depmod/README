This directory holds the modules.* files that 'depmod' generates. 

If you are building your own SB (Slax Bundle) and don't want to (or don't want your users to)
have to run 'depmod' every single time they boot SLAX, then you should do the following:

1. Boot Regular SLAX CD
2. Once in the environment, put your zfs-core, zfs-kmod bundles on a location in SLAX.
3. Activate the bundle by running 'slax activate <name of bundle>'
4. Once this is done, run 'depmod' to generate the new modules list.
5. Go to your /lib/modules/<kernel> and copy all the modules.* files to a safe location.

Once you collected those files, put all the modules.* files inside this directory and the creator
will automatically detect them and place them inside your .sb.
