1.6.3
---------
- Added the "nocache" kernel parameter. Use this if you have an
  old zpool.cache that is preventing you from booting.
- Added the "recover" kernel parameter. Use this if want to use the
  initrd as a recovery environment. (Stops initrd and goes into it
  without booting anything).

1.6.2
---------
- Added support to generate a regular initramfs that just boots directly
  into a partition with a filesystem that the kernel supports.
- Rewrote library dependency gathering algorithm
- Added better help and switch options
- Rewrote options passing algorithm
- 256 COLORS !!!

1.6.1
---------
- Rewrote the way the initramfs mounts the pool and rootfs. Now your
  "df" and "zfs list" will show the correct mount location for rootfs /
  rather than showing the location of where the initramfs mounted the pool
  "/mnt/root".
- You now must use pool_root= instead of pool_name=. Check the USAGE for more
  info.
- The initramfs now uses your zpool.cache if available. This speeds up booting
  since the initramfs doesn't need your scan for devices in order to find the
  pool.

1.6.0.1
---------
- Bug fix update, the modules directory wasn't being checked because it
  was still using the old INIT_TYPE variable. This has been fixed.

1.6.0
---------
- Colored output
- Renamed most variables and changed the prefix "JV" to "_".
- Added LUKS + ZFS support
- New application structure. The program now uses flags in order to determine
  what features were enabled. The check/copy functions are now streamlined. 
  There is also only 1 init script now and the init script also uses flags in order
  to determine what to do and what kernel modules to load.
- Init has now been modularized. Functions that init uses have moved to another
  file in the initramfs.

1.5.1
----------
- Requirement for zlib_deflate has changed. You now have to compile
  zlib_deflate into the kernel rather than as a module.
- Dependency list is now sanitized before application copies them over to
  the initramfs. This makes IO much less since it doesn't have to copy duplicates.
- File structured renamed/simplified

1.5.0-r1
----------
- Same as last release, but I forgot to uncomment the "clean all" action at the
  end of the createInit script.

1.5.0
----------
- Removed all support for LVM and RAID. The creator will now only focus on ZFS.
- Relicensed to MPLv2.
- Rewrote the parsing used to find the dynamic libraries required for the apps.
- Creator now properly gets and loads "zlib_deflate" module. This was causing
  problems at boot up because without the zlib_deflate module, an user would
  get a "unknown symbol in module or invalid parameter" error for all the other
  zfs modules.
- Added more comments, cleaned up a few comments
- The script must be ran as root in order to use depmod. The script now
  checks to see if root is the user running it.
- If depmod cannot be ran, the script will halt.

1.4.4
----------
- Added checks for 'cpio'. 
- Added ability to pass the option and kernel version you want directly
  on the command line. This will help you if you want to make a script.
- The creator now outputs the initramfs with a generic name of "initrd.img".
  This will also help you if you want to quickly copy/paste the initrd file
  into the /boot directory.
- Relicensed the application from GPLv2 to the more permissive ISC license.
- Added a few helper functions
- Removed the JV_DISTRO variable
