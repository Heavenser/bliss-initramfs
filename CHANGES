1.4.4
----------
- Added checks for 'cpio'. 
- Added ability to pass the option and kernel version you want directly
  on the command line. This will help you if you want to make a script.
- The creator now outputs the initramfs with a generic name of "initrd.img".
  This will also help you if you want to quickly copy/paste the initrd file
  into the /boot directory.
- Relicensed the application from GPLv2 to the more permissive ISC license.
- Added a few helper functions
- Removed the JV_DISTRO variable
