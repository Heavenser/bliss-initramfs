1.8.2
---------
- Relicensed back to MPLv2
- Now the initramfs will unlock multiple encrypted devices before mounting the zfs pool
  * Instructions can be found in the USAGE file

1.8.1
---------
- Fixed a bug where the initramfs wouldn't work at boot (kernel panic)
  because the initramfs wasn't packaging the files in the correct directory
  structure.
- Continued to improve application flow
- All variables have been renamed so that they don't have the "_" prefix
- Made the code more elegant in some areas

1.8.0
---------
- Restructed the program so that the SRM option can create SRMs for both
  normal and alternate kernels in sysresccd, and have them both on the root of
  your iso or usb.
- Cleaned up a lot of application flow so that the application uses the path
  variables already defined in the variables.sh rather than relying on relative
  symbols (like . represent 'here').
- Colors have been brought back to simple colors so that it can look
  as uniform as possible in most terminals or screens.
- The creator no longer makes an .md5 file for the .srms.

1.7.2
---------
- Now copies the modules.order and modules.builtin files into the initramfs 
  so the depmod program doesn't complain. These files don't have any affect 
  on the functionality of the initramfs. The initramfs will work fine without
  them.

1.7.1
---------
- Relicensed from the MPLv2 to the Simplified BSD License

1.7.0
---------
- Adds support for single user mode (via 'su' boot parameter).
  This is a really bad su mode though. Use it if you forgot to 
  change your password after installation.
- Adds support to recreate the zpool.cache from within the initramfs 
  (via 'refresh' boot parameter)
- Removed some old code that wasn't being used anymore.
- Added a few more functions to consolidate stuff.
- The version of the creator that the initramfs was made with will be displayed at boot
- Fixed bug where when asking for help via parameters (./createInit -h), it was
  pointing to the wrong location.
- Sourcing files is now done via relative path rather than using $(pwd)

1.6.9
---------
- Updated for ZoL 0.6.1

1.6.8.1
---------
- Removed remnant splat and zpios modules trying to be loaded in the init.

1.6.8
---------
- Removed the inclusion of debug modules (splat.ko, zpios.ko).

1.6.7
---------
- Fixed the sed subtitions in resources/generic.sh. The init script wouldn't boot
  up because when I relicensed the application, the deleted lines shifted the
  numbers that the sed inline substition was doing in the init file.

1.6.6
---------
- This project is now GPL compatible (again/exhibit b removed).

1.6.5
---------
- Added function that cleans up initramfs and srm directory structure
- Updated to support 0.6.0_rc14
- squashfs-tools is no longer required if you just want to make an initramfs
- udev rules are now working. This means you can make a swap partition and use it
  via /dev/zvol/<pool_name>/<swap_name> immediately from inside the sysresccd.

1.6.4
---------
- Added ZFS System Rescue Module support. The code bases for my
  initramfs creator and for the SRM creator are now merged.
- When creating a ZFS initramfs/srm, the documentation will also
  be copied.
- sys-fs/squashfs-tools must be installed on your system.
- Some functions have been consolidated.
- Restructured a bit how files are located and copied
- Normal Boot has been removed
- This project is no longer GPL compatible.
- Job control has been enabled in the initramfs

1.6.3
---------
- Added the "nocache" kernel parameter. Use this if you have an
  old zpool.cache that is preventing you from booting.
- Added the "recover" kernel parameter. Use this if want to use the
  initrd as a recovery environment. (Stops initrd and goes into it
  without booting anything).

1.6.2
---------
- Added support to generate a regular initramfs that just boots directly
  into a partition with a filesystem that the kernel supports.
- Rewrote library dependency gathering algorithm
- Added better help and switch options
- Rewrote options passing algorithm
- 256 COLORS !!!

1.6.1
---------
- Rewrote the way the initramfs mounts the pool and rootfs. Now your
  "df" and "zfs list" will show the correct mount location for rootfs /
  rather than showing the location of where the initramfs mounted the pool
  "/mnt/root".
- You now must use pool_root= instead of pool_name=. Check the USAGE for more
  info.
- The initramfs now uses your zpool.cache if available. This speeds up booting
  since the initramfs doesn't need your scan for devices in order to find the
  pool.

1.6.0.1
---------
- Bug fix update, the modules directory wasn't being checked because it
  was still using the old INIT_TYPE variable. This has been fixed.

1.6.0
---------
- Colored output
- Renamed most variables and changed the prefix "JV" to "_".
- Added LUKS + ZFS support
- New application structure. The program now uses flags in order to determine
  what features were enabled. The check/copy functions are now streamlined. 
  There is also only 1 init script now and the init script also uses flags in order
  to determine what to do and what kernel modules to load.
- Init has now been modularized. Functions that init uses have moved to another
  file in the initramfs.

1.5.1
----------
- Requirement for zlib_deflate has changed. You now have to compile
  zlib_deflate into the kernel rather than as a module.
- Dependency list is now sanitized before application copies them over to
  the initramfs. This makes IO much less since it doesn't have to copy duplicates.
- File structured renamed/simplified

1.5.0-r1
----------
- Same as last release, but I forgot to uncomment the "clean all" action at the
  end of the createInit script.

1.5.0
----------
- Removed all support for LVM and RAID. The creator will now only focus on ZFS.
- Relicensed to MPLv2.
- Rewrote the parsing used to find the dynamic libraries required for the apps.
- Creator now properly gets and loads "zlib_deflate" module. This was causing
  problems at boot up because without the zlib_deflate module, an user would
  get a "unknown symbol in module or invalid parameter" error for all the other
  zfs modules.
- Added more comments, cleaned up a few comments
- The script must be ran as root in order to use depmod. The script now
  checks to see if root is the user running it.
- If depmod cannot be ran, the script will halt.

1.4.4
----------
- Added checks for 'cpio'. 
- Added ability to pass the option and kernel version you want directly
  on the command line. This will help you if you want to make a script.
- The creator now outputs the initramfs with a generic name of "initrd.img".
  This will also help you if you want to quickly copy/paste the initrd file
  into the /boot directory.
- Relicensed the application from GPLv2 to the more permissive ISC license.
- Added a few helper functions
- Removed the JV_DISTRO variable
