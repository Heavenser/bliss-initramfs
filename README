Bliss Initramfs Creator - v2.0.1

Funtoo Linux @ ZoL 0.6.1

Distributed under the GPLv2 which can be found in the COPYING file.

This script generates an initramfs image with all the included files and 
dependencies needed to mount your zpool.

You will need a few programs already installed on your computer since this 
script just automates the process of you actually going into your filesystem,
and getting all those files.

Please have the following installed:

- Linux Kernel
  ZLIB_INFLATE/ZLIB_DEFLATE can be compiled as a module but must be declared 
  in the ADDON_MODS variable in hooks/addon.sh.
