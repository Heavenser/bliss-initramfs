Distributed under the MPL 2.0 which can be found in the LICENSE file.

This script generates an initramfs image with all the included files and 
dependencies needed to mount your filesystem.

You will need a few programs already installed on your computer since this 
program just automates the process of you actually going into your filesystem,
and getting all those files.

Please have the following installed:

- Linux Kernel
  ZLIB_INFLATE/ZLIB_DEFLATE can be compiled as a module but must be declared 
  in the ADDON_MODS variable in pkg/hooks/addon.py.
  
  General setup --->
  > [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
  > () Initramfs source file(s)

  Device Drivers --->
  > Generic Driver Options --->
  >> [*] Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev
  >> [*] Automount devtmpfs at /dev, after the kernel mounted the rootfs
     [*] Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM) --->
         <*> Device mapper support
         <*> Crypt target support

  Cryptographic API --->
  <*> XTS support

  * All other drivers required to see your PATA/SATA drives (or USB devices) need to be compiled in
    or you can compile them as a module and declare them in the ADDON_MODS variable.
