This script generates an initramfs image with all the included files and 
dependencies needed to mount your zpool.

You will need a few programs already installed on your computer since this 
script just automates the process of you actually going into your filesystem,
and getting all those files.

Please have the following installed:

- Linux Kernel
  > ZLIB_INFLATE [=y], ZLIB_DEFLATE [=m]
  > Generic Driver Options -> [*] Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev
  > Drivers needed to see your SATA/PATA drives should be compiled in
- cpio
- sys-apps/busybox with static flag
- sys-kernel/spl & spl-fs/zfs & sys-fs/zfs-kmod
