Bliss Initramfs Creator
Jonathan Vasquez <jvasquez1011@gmail.com>
Version 1.3.1 
Distributed under the MPL 2.0

This script generates an initramfs image with all the included files and dependencies.

You will need a few programs already installed on your computer since this script just automates
the process of you actually going into your filesystem, and getting all those files.

Please have the following installed:

- Linux Kernel with CONFIG_PREEMPT, CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY disabled, and ZLIB_INFLATE, ZLIB_DEFLATE enabled.
- SPL
- ZFS 
- Busybox with static flag
- cpio
- GRUB 2.00_beta3 or later (revision 4212 recommended), or a bootloader that supports ZFS.

This script and applications have been tested only on Gentoo Linux. It should
work on other distros as well.

1.3.1 Changes
-------------------
- Relicensed to the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0)
- Program has been renamed to "Bliss Initramfs Creator" since I will be supporting a few
  more configurations in future versions.
  
Changes since 1.2.6
-------------------
- The script is now POSIX compliant. Tested with dash and busybox-sh
- The script is now completely modular. The main only has function calls
- The script has added a few more functions for error messages, display messages, etc
- Verbose debugging messages were removed
- There are now two functions which check binaries and modules existing before continuing
- There are now only two functions to copy all binaries, and all modules to the initramfs

Changes since 1.2.5
-------------------
- Fixed 32 bit regex matching

Changes since 1.2.0
-------------------
- Added support for 32 bit processors (i386-i686)
- Relicensed from GPLv2 to MIT license

Changes since 1.0.0
-------------------
- Cleaned up code
- Added checks to make sure all the files exist and are being added
- Script is now parameter based. You no longer have to open up the file to add
  your kernel name. Just pass the name of your kernel and zfs pool name to the
  script. ./createInit <Kernel Name> <ZFS Pool Name>
- You no longer need to edit the init script since the createInit script now
  uses your parameters and sed to do the appropriate changes to the init file.
- Files added are now verbose (You will see what is happening)
- More variables are now available to make it easy for distros with different
  binary file placements to use this script. This makes the entire script much
  more flexible and modular.
- Added help screen with -h
