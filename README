This script generates an initramfs image with all the included files and 
dependencies needed to mount your zpool.

You will need a few programs already installed on your computer since this 
script just automates the process of you actually going into your filesystem,
and getting all those files.

Please have the following installed:

- Linux Kernel
  ZLIB_INFLATE/DEFLATE must be compiled into the kernel (not as a module).
  > ZLIB_INFLATE [=y], ZLIB_DEFLATE [=y]
  
  General setup --->
  > [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support
  > () Initramfs source file(s)

  Device Drivers --->
  > Generic Driver Options --->
  >> [*] Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev
  >> [*] Automount devtmpfs at /dev, after the kernel mounted the rootfs

  * All other drivers required to see your PATA/SATA drives must be compiled in.
