Usage
=======================================
The initramfs script is very easy to use.

1. Creating the initramfs

Just clone it or extract it into a directory and cd into it.

Run the script by running: ./createInit

If the script doesn't run and gives you a permission denied message,
give it execution permission: `chmod +x createInit` and then try again.

Select the option that you want, and tell it which kernel you want to use.

After that the required files will be gathered and packed into an initramfs.

You will find the initramfs in the directory that you are currently in.
Copy the file to your boot directory and name it whatever you want.

2. Setting it up in the bootloader

If my initramfs is called: initramfs-zfs.img and my bootloader is extlinux,
I would do the following

(open up the bootloader config (for extlinux it's extlinux.conf)

`vim /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf`

and add a new entry:

 LABEL funtoo
	MENU LABEL Funtoo [3.4.3-ZFS]
	LINUX /kernel-3.4.3-ZFS
	INITRD /initramfs-zfs.img
	APPEND pool_name=rpool
	
This would boot my `rpool` zpool. `poolname` is the kernel parameter to declare
the zpool that you want to boot into.

=======================================
Kernel Options:
=======================================
LVM:

fstype - filesystem type (root)
	example: APPEND fstype=ext4

options - options to use for mounting this partition
	example: APPEND options=ro
	
pool_name - LVM pool name
	example: APPEND pool_name=funtoo
	
pool_root - root logical volume in the LVM
	example: APPEND pool_root=root
	
So a complete line could look like this:
 APPEND fstype=ext4 options=ro pool_name=funtoo pool_root=root
 
 Which would mount the /dev/funtoo/root partition read-only (and take into account
 that the filesystem type for this partition is ext4).
 
ZFS:

pool_name - ZFS pool name
	example: APPEND pool_name=rpool

cache_size - Sets the ARC cache size (in bytes)
	example: APPEND cache_size=536870912
		this sets the cache_size to 512MB

So a complete line could look like this:
 APPEND cache_size=536870912 pool_name=rpool
 
 Which would mount the `rpool` ZFS pool with the arc_max being 512 MB
